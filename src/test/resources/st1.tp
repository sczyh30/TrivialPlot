--- A simple example

origin is (100, 300);
rot is 0;
scale is (1, 1);

for T from 0 to 200 step 1 draw (T, 0);

--- Signature:
--- draw(from, to, step, func)

--- Reactive pattern (Scala-like syntax):
--- (a to b).step(c)
---   .func(f)
---   .color(BLUE)
---   .draw

for T from 0 to 120 step 1 draw (T, -T);

for T from 0 to 15 step 0.1 draw (T, -(T**2));

for T from 0 to 6 step 0.01 draw (T, -(T**3));
